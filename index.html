SCORING & RESULTS:
SCORE CALCULATION:
Total possible points: 45 (15 questions × 3 points max)

TIER 1: READY (38-45 points)
Headline: You're Ready—But Stay Sharp
Result message:
You've done the work most people skip. You understand that retirement is a transition, not a reward. You've thought beyond the money and built structure around purpose, relationships, health, and logistics.
What to focus on:

Execute your 90-day transition plan in the first quarter
Revisit your withdrawal guardrails quarterly as markets shift
Schedule your Kitchen Table Summit with your spouse in Month 1
Download Tool 3 (Disenchantment Alert Tracker) to monitor emotional phases

Your biggest risk: Overconfidence. Even with preparation, the emotional arc will surprise you. Stay vigilant for disenchantment phases and adjust.
Recommended chapter focus: Chapter 3 (Emotional Arc), Chapter 15 (Legacy in Motion)

TIER 2: ALMOST THERE (28-37 points)
Headline: Close—But Fill These Gaps
Result message:
You're ahead of most people, but there are critical gaps that could derail your transition. You've likely focused heavily on one area (probably finances) while neglecting others (identity, relationships, logistics).
What needs attention:
Review your answers. Where did you score 0-1 points? Those are your vulnerabilities.
Common gaps at this level:

Financial plan exists, but no withdrawal strategy or guardrails
Haven't had structured conversations with spouse about daily life
Legal documents outdated or missing
No plan for social connection after work disappears
Health neglected during working years

Next steps:

This month: Complete the Decision Audit (Tool 1) to identify your weakest areas
This quarter: Address your two lowest-scoring categories with specific action
Before retiring: Schedule Kitchen Table Summit with spouse (Chapter 11)

Recommended chapter focus: Whatever category you scored lowest in—start there.

TIER 3: WORK TO DO (16-27 points)
Headline: You're Not Ready—Here's How to Get There
Result message:
You're thinking about retirement, but you haven't built the infrastructure to make it work. Right now, you're headed for the retirement trap: enough money, no roadmap.
The reality:
Most men at this level retire anyway. They assume financial security equals readiness. Six months in, they're restless, directionless, and wondering why retirement doesn't feel like they expected.
What you need:
Not motivation. Structure. You need frameworks for the five areas you're unprepared for:

Identity: Who are you without your job title?
Purpose: What will you do when no one's telling you what to do?
Finances: Do you have a withdrawal strategy or just a number?
Relationships: Have you discussed what daily life looks like with your spouse?
Logistics: Does anyone know how to access your accounts if something happens?

Start here:

Read The Retirement Trap from start to finish—don't skip chapters
Complete the Decision Audit (Tool 1) before making any retirement decision
If you're within 12 months of retiring, delay until you've addressed gaps
Schedule conversations: spouse (Chapter 11), financial advisor (Chapter 6), estate attorney (Chapter 14)

Your timeline: 6-12 months of structured prep before retirement
Recommended chapter focus: Start with Chapter 1 (Decision Audit), then Chapters 2-4 (Identity/Purpose), then your lowest-scoring category.

TIER 4: NOT READY (0-15 points)
Headline: Don't Retire Yet
Result message:
If you retired tomorrow, you would struggle. Not because you lack resources—because you lack preparation. Retirement isn't a vacation. It's a life redesign. Right now, you have no design.
Hard truth:
You're likely focused on one question: "Do I have enough money?" That's the wrong question. The right question is: "Am I ready for what comes after the paycheck stops?"
Based on your answers, you're not.
What happens if you retire now:

Month 1-3: Honeymoon phase. Feels great to escape work stress.
Month 4-6: Restlessness sets in. Days feel shapeless. You're bored but don't know what to do.
Month 7-12: Identity crisis. Who are you without work? Marriage friction increases. Social isolation grows.
Year 2+: Either you course-correct (hard) or you drift into depression, health decline, and resentment.

What you need to do:

Don't set a retirement date yet. You're not ready.
Read The Retirement Trap cover to cover—this is your roadmap.
Work through every tool as you read each chapter.
Address these gaps systematically:

Build a withdrawal strategy (not just a portfolio balance)
Define what you'll do with your time (not "relax"—actual plans)
Have explicit conversations with your spouse about daily life
Update legal documents and organize your digital estate
Get a comprehensive health screening and build fitness baseline


Retake this quiz in 6 months. Don't retire until you score 28+.

Timeline: 12-18 months minimum before retirement
Start immediately: Chapter 1 (Decision Audit). Don't skip ahead.
